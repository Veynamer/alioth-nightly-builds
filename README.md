# Nightly personal PostmarketOS Builds

This repository contains workflows and configurations to automatically build PostmarketOS edge images for personal devices supported by our mainline kernel fork. These images are intended for testing purposes only and should make testing more accessible to people without the capabilities to compile the kernel from source.

## Image Information

The CI builds images once per week on fridays at midnight UTC. When completed, it will upload artifacts for each device that was built. These artifacts contain `boot.img` and an xz-compressed rootfs. Artifacts are kept for one week (i.e. until the next rebuild).

The default user is called `user`, the password is `147147`, just like on official PostmarketOS stable images.

## Downloading

Head to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Veynamer/alioth-nightly-builds/actions), select the most recent successful run and download the artifact for your device. Extract the Zip, de-compress the rootfs and you're ready to flash!
